## 🛡️ Sector-Specific Solutions

### 🏥 Healthcare: Protecting Patient Life & Privacy
Generic cloud AI creates unacceptable risks for Protected Health Information (PHI). 
*   **The Risk:** Data breaches, unauthorized re-identification, and non-compliance with HIPAA/GDPR.
*   **Our Solution:** On-premise diagnostic AI and clinical agents that process patient records locally. Securely analyze genomic data and medical imaging without external API calls.

### 🎖️ Military & Defense: Mission-Critical Intelligence
In theater or at HQ, connectivity is a vulnerability. 
*   **The Risk:** Intelligence leaks, reliance on unpredictable cloud latency, and foreign infrastructure dependencies.
*   **Our Solution:** Air-gapped AI deployments for edge computing, situational awareness, and predictive maintenance. We ensure mission data stays in-country and under command.

### 🏦 Finance: High-Stakes Security & Compliance
Financial data is a primary target for sophisticated cyber threats and subject to strict residency laws.
*   **The Risk:** Cross-border data transfer violations, trade secret exposure, and third-party infrastructure vulnerabilities.
*   **Our Solution:** Private AI for real-time fraud detection, risk modeling, and automated compliance auditing. Maintain full auditability while keeping transactional data local.
