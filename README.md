## 🏗️ Our Technical Approach: "Privacy-first-Infrastructure"

### 🏥 Healthcare: Private ML Models
**Use Case:** Training diagnostic models on patient data.
*   **The Solution:** Using **Flynt Studio**, healthcare providers can build ML models that analyze local Electronic Health Records (EHR). 
*   **Result:** Clinicians gain AI-driven insights while patient data remains protected by physical on-site hardware, ensuring 100% HIPAA and GDPR compliance.

### 🎖️ Military & Defense: Sovereign Command
**Use Case:** Edge intelligence in disconnected environments.
*   **The Solution:** Deployment of **Local MCPs** to allow Agentic AI to interface with local sensor data and tactical databases.
*   **Result:** Strategic intelligence stays in-theater and under command, with zero risk of interception via external cloud APIs.

### 🏦 Finance: Zero-Leakage Analytics
**Use Case:** Real-time fraud detection and risk modeling.
*   **The Solution:** Local RAG pipelines that process transactional history and market data within the bank's internal firewalls.
*   **Result:** High-speed AI inference with no cross-border data transfer risks or third-party exposure.
